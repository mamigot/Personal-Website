This code powers <a href="http://miguelamigotgonzalez.com">my personal website</a>.

It was built using PHP, MySQL and the PDO driver as well as the Twitter Bootstrap framework. Pages that are visible to the user are those on the root directory. They rely on shared content and code that is saved in the “includes” directory. Some files return heredocs to facilitate the HTML-editing process on the server, and others interact with the database.

In the future I plan on implementing a large portion of the site through front-end Javascript in order to increase the speed with which pages are rendered from the server.
