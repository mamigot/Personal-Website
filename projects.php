            <p class="lead">Our mission is to provide organizations with the latest educational technology and content, including open source or custom-built platforms, marketing-oriented web development and the production of MOOCs and blended courses. One of our favorite products is the open source, amazing <a href="http://iblstudios.com/products_services/open-source-platforms/open-edx/">edX platform</a> for online courses, which we fully integrate and maintain for educational institutions and businesses that rely on workforce training programs.</p>

Our model's innovative appeal evidently relies on a continuous improvement of the services we offer.

            <p class="lead">
              Implemented the first phase of a "smart" content manager system (CMS) using Javascript and PHP as well as the Raptor Editor, FAROO Search and Alchemy APIs. The objective is to integrate existing tools to make the best possible CMS. Not only does the text editor need to follow the WYSIWYG model, but it needs to allow the user to create content that is relevant from an SEO perspective.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The former entailed the use of the open-source Raptor Editor and the latter was achieved through FAROO, which performed filtered search queries for user-entered keywords or topics and instantaneously returned a series of relevant results. These were not only displayed, but inputted through Alchemy to obtain relevant keywords and analyses based on the API's machine learning technology.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The project continues to be developed by my friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherwoessner">Chris Woessner</a> and I, since we plan on drastically improving the functionality and user-experience components in the near future.

              <p class="lead">We coded on virtual machines through Amazon Web Services' <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2 instances</a> because of their versatility in regards to web-scaling, safety and their set-up. Repeatedly, we pushed our code to develop, staging and master branches in <a href=" https://github.com/miguel5/bitstarter">Github </a> and Heroku. All was geared towards a final project and, even though <a href=" http://sthub.herokuapp.com/">mine</a> is still in development-phase, I've learned an invaluable amount of stuff and I feel confident to use what I've learned to create something awesome. </p>

              <h3>Start-ups and Business</h3>
              <p class="lead">The course was not only great because of what it taught about software engineering, but because of what we learned about start-ups and markets. Feel free to browse through the lectures via the link above. </p>

            <div class="col-lg-7">
              <p class="lead">We performed market analyses and studied start-ups' economies of scale. There are many interesting lessons and graphics that the instructors provided, namely that titled "Market size vs. novelty" which incentivizes entrepreneurs to determine the kinds of products they'll have to build in order to achieve a specific status in the industry. </p>
              <p class="lead">Not saying that the lower-left category is worthless (think about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/22/source-snapchat-snaps-up-80m-from-ivp-at-a-800m-valuation/">Snapchat</a>, which built an app that found an incredibly high great demand from young people), but I think that a product that has the capacity to make a positive difference in the world must fall closer to the right on the graph. Of course, there are always factors like regulation and lack of funding that tempt us into making a most-start-ups-like product, but still. If we are in a position wherein we can help others, we must do so. </p>
              <p class="lead">Further, we studied ubiquitous facets of inbound marketing like  search-engine optimization and the implementation of analytics, as well as strategies in product development pertaining to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Product</a> and the surge and increasing relevance of mobile technology, among others. </p>
              <p class="lead">The professors provided incredibly rich guidance for those of us who are launching start-ups through their lectures, but they also pointed us to great material like <a href="http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup">Peter Thiel's start-up course</a> and <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham's essays</a>. </p>
              <p class="lead">I look forward to implementing all I've learned and taking more MOOCs in the future. </p>

              <p class="lead">
                Everyone who studies Engineering at NYU-Poly takes Introduction to Engineering and Design (EG1003)</a>, marked by a semester-long project for which students in groups of two or three design, program and assemble fully-autonomous robots to endure obstacle courses. I took the course in the fall of 2012, and my friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/vicente-ochoa-jr/75/191/a09">Vicente Ochoa</a> and I were assigned the <a href="https://manual.eg.poly.edu/index.php/Bomb_Disarming_Robot_(BDR)"> Bomb Disarming Robot</a> or BDR.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Assigned to reach a checkpoint and safely return to its starting-point, the BDR faced an obstacle course that was riddled with several types of hills, decoy "bombs" (they seemed like buttons to the less imaginative eye) and challenges which could only be overcome if its mechanical structure fulfilled a number of characteristics. Programming the robot was also complicated, considering that our intention was to primarily rely on its sensors even though the circuit did not always allow it.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Despite the technical challenges that the robot presented, the goal of the project was to introduce us to facets of "real-world engineering" that few other courses would cover, such as cost estimation and project planning software. Most importantly, we were taught to present and discuss our milestones and achievements in a public setting. Not as students in an introductory engineering course, but as salesmen and marketers pitching our products. For our final presentation, we had to "sell" our robot to our professor.

                Fortunately, Vicente and I were successful and we were awarded the <strong>Nick Russo Award for Outstanding General Engineering and Design</strong>. In the words of Richard, my TA:

              <blockquote>
                <p>You showed ingenuity, quick thinking, and guts (risk taker). Presentation was flawless in describing your final design over your original design. Your team fulfilled the purpose of this final presentation to sell your idea to potential investors. Not only was the design extremely effective, you sold the idea the best.</p>

              <p class="lead">Considering that technology is increasingly becoming mobile and that this requires websites to be responsive to differently-sized screens, I decided to redesign and code my site with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap 3</a>. The back-end is powered by PHP and I'm using the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13569/mysqli-or-pdo-what-are-the-pros-and-cons">PDO driver</a> to store all data in a MySQl database. Mainly through my <a href="http://cms.miguelamigotgonzalez.com/">CMS</a>, I'm working to implement front-end Javascript. </p>

              <p class="lead">When I was learning PHP, I decided to build a basic online forum that would handle questions and comments, which are stored on a MySQL database. Doing so taught me to code <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> applications (being <a href="http://cms.miguelamigotgonzalez.com/">built</a> at the moment), which only differ from this forum because of the few added MySQL commands. </p>

              <p class="lead">Though the scope of Google Apps Script is fairly limited from a web development standpoint, it is useful because it is based on Javascript --the soon-to-become <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/08/09/why-javascript-will-become-the-dominant-programming-language-of-the-enterprise#awesm=~of1E0vivDT7ybJ">"dominant language of the enterprise for IT".</a></p>
